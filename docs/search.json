    "text": "Who?\nElise Wong is currently a sophomore at the National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing her undergraduate degree in Communications and New Media with a Second Major in Sociology.\n\n\nWhat?\nElise’s active engagement in the arts, especially her passion for music, serves as a living testament to how communication transcends mere words and text - as an active member and one of the leaders of Raffles Hall’s rock band, RHockerfellas, Elise rocks the stage with her electric guitar skills, playing to her various audiences, reinforcing the idea that music itself is a powerful form of communication.\n\n\nWhy?\nThis affinity for music has also guided her choice of dataset for her Data Story Final Project. Given her background and profound interest in music, she decided to work with Spotify statistics. By analysing Spotify data, she can combine her academic knowledge with her passion for music, creating a project that resonates with her on a personal level.\nIn all, Elise believes that this synergy between her passion and the chosen dataset will enable her to produce a project that is not only academically rigorous but also emotionally fulfilling.\nThis website was developed as part of the Data Story Final Project for the NM2207 (‘Computational Media Literacy’) course, during AY23/24 Semester 1."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the ever-evolving world of music, I embarked on a captivating journey to explore the intricate tapestry of Spotify’s genre classification system. Spanning six decades from 1957 to 2020, this musical time machine allowed me to witness how music genres have not only shaped themselves but have been profoundly influenced by changing industry dynamics and listener preferences.\nThis exploration became all the more pertinent in the face of a rapidly transforming music landscape. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (2022), the revenues from streaming music have surged, accounting for a staggering 84% of total music revenues in the first half of 2021. Spotify, in particular, has spearheaded this revolution and emerged as the “world’s biggest music streaming provider in terms of global paid-for subscriptions” (Music Business Worldwide, 2023), with projections indicating continued dominance throughout the 2020s (Goldman Sachs, 2023). Concurrently, digital music platforms have ushered in a shift from rigid “hard genre categorisation” to a more fluid “mood-based categorisation” approach, a strategy aimed at promoting new music through effective exposure (The Guardian, 2017).\nAs such, the examination of the evolution of music genre categorisation on Spotify in response to songs released is not merely an academic exercise; it is a lens through which we gain insights into the dynamic interplay of change and continuity within the music industry. This understanding can guide business strategies and offer valuable insights into the ever-evolving music landscape, especially within our increasingly digitalised society."
