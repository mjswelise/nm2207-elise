    "text": "Who?\nElise Wong is currently a sophomore at the National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing her undergraduate degree in Communications and New Media with a Second Major in Sociology.\n\n\nWhat?\nElise’s active engagement in the arts, especially her passion for music, serves as a living testament to how communication transcends mere words and text - as an active member and one of the leaders of Raffles Hall’s rock band, RHockerfellas, Elise rocks the stage with her electric guitar skills, playing to her various audiences, reinforcing the idea that music itself is a powerful form of communication.\n\n\nWhy?\nThis affinity for music has also guided her choice of dataset for her Data Story Final Project. Given her background and profound interest in music, she decided to work with Spotify statistics. By analysing Spotify data, she can combine her academic knowledge with her passion for music, creating a project that resonates with her on a personal level.\nIn all, Elise believes that this synergy between her passion and the chosen dataset will enable her to produce a project that is not only academically rigorous but also emotionally fulfilling.\nThis website was developed as part of the Data Story Final Project for the NM2207 (‘Computational Media Literacy’) course, during AY23/24 Semester 1."
